I am a Lead Specialty Software Engineer with 18 years of experience specializing in Python development, systems integration, and backend solutions. My career has been defined by a passion for designing robust, scalable, and secure systems that drive efficiency and cost savings across enterprise environments.

Currently, I serve as a Lead Specialty Software Engineer at Wells Fargo, where I focus on Python and systems integration/orchestration. I have a proven track record of leading the development of innovative CI/CD pipelines, optimizing enterprise workflows, and implementing automation that delivers measurable business value. My work has resulted in significant cost reductions, such as transitioning from Anaconda to Miniforge to save over $2 million annually, and streamlining deployment processes with Docker and OpenShift.

I am recognized for my critical thinking, persistent problem-solving, and commitment to evolving development workflows. I thrive in collaborative environments, working across technical teams and business lines to deliver solutions that are both effective and sustainable. My technical toolkit includes Python, Django, FastAPI, Flask, Docker, OpenShift, GitHub Actions, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, and more.

In addition to my hands-on engineering work, I am an advocate for test-driven development and continuous improvement, ensuring high code quality and reliability. I have also contributed to the tech community through publications and presentations, including articles on Medium and talks at Oracle Open World.
